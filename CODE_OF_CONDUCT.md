# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language:** Please be mindful of the language you use in all interactions.
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences:** Embrace diversity of thought and acknowledge that others may have different perspectives.
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism:** Learn from feedback and use it to improve.
- **Focusing on what is best for the community:** Prioritize the well-being and success of the community over personal gains.
- **Showing empathy towards other community members:** Understand and appreciate the challenges others may face.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment and abuse:** Any form of harassment, including unwanted sexual attention or advances.
- **Trolling or inflammatory comments:** Avoid comments that incite negative behavior or disrupt community harmony.
- **Discrimination or derogatory remarks:** Do not use language or behavior that discriminates against any individual or group.
- **Public or private intimidation:** Any actions intended to intimidate or isolate community members.
- **Releasing private information:** Do not share personal details (such as addresses or contact information) without consent.
- **Any other conduct that could be reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting.**

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include:

- Using an official project email address or social media account.
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at contact@datai.network. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially, and appropriate responses will be taken as necessary.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the projectâ€™s leadership.
