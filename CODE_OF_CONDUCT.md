# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of creating an open and welcoming environment, we as maintainers, contributors, and community members pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in any form, including the use of offensive stereotypes or slurs.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including our GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussion forums, community chats, and public events. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces outside of these platforms.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, or have other concerns, please report it by contacting us at contact@datai.network. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and confidentially. We will take appropriate action to address the situation.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow a fair and consistent process for enforcing this Code of Conduct:

1. **Warning:** A private, written warning clarifying the nature of the violation.
2. **Temporary Ban:** Temporary restriction from community spaces if the behavior continues.
3. **Permanent Ban:** For severe or repeated violations, a permanent removal from all community interactions.

## Acknowledgement and Improvement

This Code of Conduct is based on best practices widely used in open-source communities. We welcome feedback and suggestions to make it more effective. The community and maintainers are committed to continually improving the health and inclusivity of our environment.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.
