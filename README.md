## Introduction

The Datai Projections SDK is a modular library designed to simplify the process of integrating with our decentralized data network. It is intended for developers who want to create custom integrations, contribute new functionalities, or extend the capabilities of the Datai ecosystem.

For an in-depth guide on building your first projection, please see our [Developer Documentation](https://datai.network/docs/developers/developing-your-first-projection/).

## What is a Projection?

Within the Datai network, a **projection** is a specialized data integration module that:

- **Interacts with decentralized data streams:** Connect and process data from various endpoints.
- **Scales network capabilities:** Enable advanced data handling and distribution.
- **Extends functionality:** Allow developers to implement custom logic tailored to their application needs.

This modular approach is key to expanding the network’s reach and utility.

---

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js (v14+)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Basic knowledge of decentralized systems and API integrations

### Installation

You can install the SDK via npm or Yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install datai-projections-sdk

# Using Yarn
yarn add datai-projections-sdk
```

---

## Usage

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize the SDK and create a new projection:

```javascript
// Import the Datai Projections SDK
const DataiProjections = require('datai-projections-sdk');

// Initialize the SDK with your configuration
const sdk = new DataiProjections({
  network: 'mainnet', // Use 'testnet' for development/testing
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});

// Function to create a new projection
async function createProjection() {
  try {
    const projectionConfig = {
      name: 'MyFirstProjection',
      description: 'A sample projection for data integration',
      endpoints: ['https://api.example.com/data']
    };

    const result = await sdk.createProjection(projectionConfig);
    console.log('Projection created successfully:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating projection:', error);
  }
}

createProjection();
```

For more detailed usage examples and advanced configurations, please refer to our [Developer Documentation](https://datai.network/docs/developers/developing-your-first-projection/).

## API Reference

For complete details on available methods and configurations, please see our API documentation (coming soon). Here are a few common methods:

- **`createProjection(config)`**: Creates a new projection with the specified configuration.
- **`updateProjection(id, config)`**: Updates an existing projection.
- **`deleteProjection(id)`**: Removes a projection from the network.
- **`listProjections()`**: Retrieves a list of all active projections.
